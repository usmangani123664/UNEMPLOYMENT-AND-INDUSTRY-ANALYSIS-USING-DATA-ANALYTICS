## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the unemployment rate and industry trends in India between 2019 and 2020. The analysis uses Python and various libraries for exploratory data analysis (EDA). It focuses on real-world datasets to provide accurate insights.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/usmangani123664/UNEMPLOYMENT-AND-INDUSTRY-ANALYSIS-USING-DATA-ANALYTICS.git
cd UNEMPLOYMENT-AND-INDUSTRY-ANALYSIS-USING-DATA-ANALYTICS
```

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. It is recommended to use Python 3.6 or higher. You will also need to install the following libraries:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
```

## Data Sources
